Queen Hesh is a moderated fork of the Void re-edited by Me. You can make your Whatsapp Group more handy with the help of this bot. To create your own bot fork this bot and edit it or, just download this fork, edit it and upload as your new project. Since this is an open source project, You have all the rights to re-code this program. To deploy this bot on a  server and add to Your Whatsapp Account simply click the "Deploy" Button on top and follow the instructions. After deploying this bot to Heroku, You may face a big problem. If you are using a free Heroku account, then your bot will automatically sleep after 30 minutes (Don't worry. It will recover itself after someone used it again. But this will take some times). This hapens because You get only one dyno with a free account. So the apps with a single dyno will fall into a sleep if the dyno didn't recieve any traffic for 30 Mins. To avoid this you have to buy another dyno by paying for it (Apps with two or more dynos will never sleep). Or you can simply use a website to keep your app awake for free. For do that you have to [Click here](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/) and visit a site called "Kaffeine" and paste your Heroku app name in there. (Heroku app name is the name that you given to the app in the deploy page)
