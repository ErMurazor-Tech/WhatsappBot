## ðŸ˜• About

Queen Hesh is a moderated fork of the Void Whatsapp bot. This is moderated by Er Murazor (me). The bot is named after the second name of my one and only crush.
This programm is made with typescripts. So after you deploy this on Heroku, the bot will automatically sleep after sometime if you're using a free Heroku account.
To avoid this in a legal way, You want to have a Paid Heroku Account. Or you can use a site to keep your bot alive till the deadline of your dyno hrs. [Click here to visit the site](http://kaffeine.herokuapp.com/)
